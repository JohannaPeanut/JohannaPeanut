Hi, I'm Johanna 🍐 web developer and visual artist

I just graduated from a 6 months web development program at Ironhack.
As an artist I have been coding for a while - self-taught with Python, HTML, CSS, JS and a lot of try and error.

My current stack:
JavaScript (ES6) React.js HTML CSS SASS Node.js Express.js MongoDB Python Bootstrap Handlebars Mongoose NPM Axios REST API Git&GitHub
